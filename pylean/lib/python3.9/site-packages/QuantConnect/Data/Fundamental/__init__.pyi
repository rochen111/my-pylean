In calculating the revenue per share growth rate, we calculate the slope of the regression line of historical revenue per share.

The result of the regression is a normalized historical increase or decrease in the rate of growth for sales per share. We then calculate a z-score by subtracting the universe mean revenue growth from the company's revenue growth, and dividing by the standard deviation of the universe's growth rates. Stocks are sorted based on the z-score of their revenue per share growth rate calculated above, from the most negative z-score to the most positive z-score.
